# Hi, I'm GK üëã
 
üë®‚Äçüíª **General Software Engineer** | üéì **A Pragmatic Engineer loves to solve hard and challenging problems** | üöÄ **Currently exploring Generative AI solutions**

### About Me
 
I'm a first-principles thinker üß† who believes that fundamentals and curiosity are key to solving engineering problems. My journey in tech started back in 11th grade when I got my first Android phone. I was obsessed with exploring every feature and setting, learning by breaking things and figuring out how to fix them. Modding Android and customizing it to fit my needs taught me how software really works, and that curiosity pushed me to study computer science üíª.

Fast forward today, I'm the **first-generation graduate and software engineer** in my family üéìüë®‚Äçüíª. It hasn't been an easy path and I'm still pushing forward. I graduated from Clemson University and have been actively looking for new oppurtunites. Please reachout to me if you looking for someone well rounded software engineer.

I don't tie myself to any specific programming language. I see languages and frameworks as tools to craft the art of programming. I can wear multiple hats üé© according to the context while building a product. Thinking like a PM to understand who are clients of this solution, what are their needs, designing systems as an architect for fault tolerance and high availability, and digging into the nuanced things as an engineer to understand the system well and optimize it.

### Outside of Work
When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering with DIY projects, taking things apart to see how they work, or diving into the latest tech trends. I love traveling to discover new places and cultures, and recently, I've started hitting the gym to stay active.

Let's connect! üòä  
I'm always excited to meet new people, share ideas, and learn from others. Whether you want to chat about tech, collaborate on a project, or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
